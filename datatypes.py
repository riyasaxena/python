# this is a program to kwno data type
# I thought python will blow up if I give such a big mnumber
# but to our surprise it worked perfectly fine for such a long integer
# we took a variable name x (can be anything)
x = 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 
# we initialised it with a long long value
x = x+ 1
# we added just 1 to it
print (x)
# printed the new answer
